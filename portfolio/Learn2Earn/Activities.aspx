        <h3>Clavius  Mentoring Program (C)</h3>
        <p>High School students act as mentors, working in the middle schools assisting the educators teaching robotics, and the middle school students. These high schoolers devote 40 to 50 hours helping the schools they work in and are a part of their team. They organize and run the jamboree and in some cases, take on extra assignments to help Clavius function. Some work in multiple schools racking up double or triple the time they work with these kids. As a mentor they help middle schoolers figure out problems and issues and are trained to help them run the race with them, not run it for them.</p>

        <p>Saint Louis University High currently offers two introductory robotics camps, The first utilizes EV3 click and drag programming software to program various robot behaviors. The students are taught the whole array of behaviors, sensors, loops etc. Challenges are given throughout the camp for the students to master. Middle school students are exposed to high school technology teachers and high school student mentors during the camp. The second camp is the same as the first, only it utilizes Robot C programming language software to program the robots behaviors.</p>

        <p>This is an international competition organized by FIRST for elementary and middle school students. Each year in August, FIRST LEGO League introduces a scientific and real-world challenge for teams to focus and research on. The robotics part of the competition involves designing and programming LEGO Mindstorm robots to complete tasks. The students work out solutions to the various problems they are given and then meet for regional tournaments to share their knowledge, compare ideas, and display their robots. Students will be awarded scholarship credit.</p>

        <h3>FIRST TECH Challenge (FTC)</h3>
        <h4>Grades 7–12</h4>
        <p>The FIRST Tech Challenge (FTC) is designed for students in grades 7–12 to compete head to head, using a sports model. Teams are responsible for designing, building, and programming their robots in a 10-week build period to compete in an alliance format against other teams. The robot kit is reusable from year-to-year and is programmed using Java or the MIT App Inventor. Teams, including coaches, mentors and volunteers, are required to develop strategy and build robots based on sound engineering principles. Awards are given for the competition as well as for community outreach, design, and other real-world accomplishments. The ultimate goal of FTC is to reach more young people with a lower-cost, more accessible opportunity to discover the excitement and rewards of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science,_technology,_engineering,_and_mathematics" target="_blank">Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics</a>.</p>

        <p>High-school student participants call it “the hardest fun you’ll ever have.” Under strict rules, limited resources, and an intense six-week time limit, teams of 20 or more students are challenged to raise funds, design a team "brand," hone teamwork skills, and build and program industrial-size robots to play a difficult field game against like-minded competitors. It’s as close to real-world engineering as a student can get. Volunteer professional mentors lend their time and talents to guide each team.

        <p>Students participate in school STEM programming called Quest. Quest provides the opportunity for student-driven, real-world STEM application. Students meet in small, mixed-grade groups one day a week for 1 ½ hours. Teachers and other outside partners facilitate the groups. This year, projects are centered on the topic of sustainability, namely related to the United Nations sustainability goals. These groups name a problem, research background information, develop a plan for solving the problem, and create, evaluate, and revise their solution. When groups finish their project, they will pick up another one. Some of the current projects include building a bee hive, redesigning and building our school garden beds, refurbishing furniture for women’s transitional housing, and creating a plan for more energy efficiency at school, among others.</p>

In each level, students participate in instruction and matches once a week for an hour for 10 weeks. Kkills go beyond just the classroom, students learn to become better decision makers. Our goal is to build champions in the classroom, and the community.</p>
