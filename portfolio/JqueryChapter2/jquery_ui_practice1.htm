                <h2>Bingebox</h2>
                <p>The brand-new Bingebox is the second best thing in gaming consoles. The best selling game 'Mortal Wombat' scores high with fans 
                    with new arenas and missions in which highest points are awarded for helping your opponent overcome some personal life challenge. 
                    The new finishing moves have been added which allow you to finish helping your opponent by offering some words of wisdom, or you 
                    can now use the new 'Spirit Lifter' and say something really nice about them.

            <div id="Wa">
                <h2>Wa</h2>
                <p>The new Wa has recently come out with it's very own "Fabio Galaxy" and "Fabio's World 4" in which the princess is once again in 
                    trouble and you play as Super Fabio who is ready to take on the world to save the princess. Unfortunately Fabio lost a leg when he 
                    tripped over an ill-placed sewer drain in "Fabios World 3" and despite best attempts, the leg was never recovered. There is hope 
                    though as rumor has it that a half-crazed turtle was recently seen carrying Fabio's leg from world 1 to world 2 and there seems to 
                    be some buzz that Fabio's leg may return in "Fabio's World 5".
